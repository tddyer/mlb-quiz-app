# Quizzler ❓

## Overview

This project is my implementation of the Quizzler app built while following "The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp using Dart" by the London App Brewery and Angela Yu on LinkedIn Learning (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/flutter-part-06-modularizing-and-organizing-flutter-code).

## What you will create

We’re going to make a quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores, you can create your own quiz for other people to enjoy!


## What you will learn

- Modularising your code into separate classes.
- Dart classes and objects.
- Using class constructors.
- Extracting Widgets to refactor your code.
- private and public modifiers in Dart.
- How to use Dart lists.
- The difference between var, const and final.
